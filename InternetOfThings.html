    <h2>What is the internet of things (IOT)?</h2>
    <p>The internet of things refers to a network of objects that are able to communicate with each other by passing data over the internet.</p>
    <h3>Examples of IOT:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A thermostat and radiator could communicate with each other such that if the room temperature drops below a threshold then the radiator will turn on</li>
        <li>A clock and light could communicate with each other such that if the time goes past a certain hour in the night then the lights turn off</li>
        <li>A door and burglar alarm could communicate with each other such that if the door is locked then the alarm is activated</li>
    </ul>
